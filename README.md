The NMT model was trained using [OpenNMT-py](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py).

The game text from *[Persona 5 Royal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_5)* was used as analysis data.

## Game Data â€” Corpus

[`game-data`](/game-data.csv) shows the amount of bitexts collected from each game used to form the corpus for my study.

In total, 767.4k bitexts were used, of which 625k bitexts where used for training the NMT model.


## Translation Quality Assessment Model

[`tqa-model.csv`](/tqa-model.csv) is my TQA model provided as a `.csv` file for easy access.


## Examples

[`examples.csv`](/examples.csv) contains all examples used in my thesis. The file provides

- Example number as presented in the thesis
